Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
==================
Comments:
==================
- Great Visuals/CGI
    *I liked how the show recreated the atmospheres of the planets, which was very interesting

-I also enjoyed the soundtrack, which made the episode so much more riveting 

- I like the host, Niel Tyson, because he's so passionate about the cosmos and astronomy

- I liked that the show journeyed into the history of astronomy as well, with the discussion of numerous early astronomers

- I found it helpful that the show shrunk the history of the universe into a year, making it so much easier to contextualize 


====================
What I learned:
====================
- A cloud of comets, the Oort Cloud encloses our solar system (the 2nd line of our cosmic address)

- Rogue planets are frozen planets that may contain water, or life

- Virgo supercluster is a collection of billions of galaxies

- Giordano Bruno was an Italian monk who read and theorized about the universe. This was outlawed by the Catholic Church, and as a result, he was kicked out from the church.
  *He theorized that the universe was infinite
  *He believed that the universe was filled with other suns orbited by other planets
  *Believed that an infinite God would create an infinite universe
  *Excommunicated from churches in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, England. 
  *Imprisoned for 8 years in Italy
  *Burned at the stake for not recanting

- After the Big Bang, gravity pulled together clumps of helium and hydrogen to create stars

- In the last 14 seconds of the "calender of the universe" was all of recorded history 

- 30,000 years ago, our ancestors invented astronomy to aid their survival

- Carl Sagan was a 20th century scientist who contributed a lot to our current understanding of the universe

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
==================
Comments:
==================
- Much like episode 1, episode 3 discusses the history of humans and astronomy. But in this episode, it goes more in depth about the human perception of astronomical events

====================
What I learned:
====================
- Humans evolved pattern recognition over hundreds of generations

- Our early ancestors looked up at the stars to direct their lives, and assumed that whatever happened in the sky was directed towards them
  *So when they saw comets, they took it as a bad sign

- Jan Oort, a Dutch astronomer in 1950s concluded that comets needed to come from a sphere of comets surrounding the sun, known as the Oort cloud
  *He was the first to map the Milky Way and our position in the Milky Way

- Edmond Halley, an English astronomer in the 17th century, was not fearful of comets like those at his time
  *He was the first to make a complete star map of the Southern Hemisphere
  *Made the first map of the Earth's magnetic field
  *Perfected the diving bell
  *Invented the weather map
  *Measured distance from Earth to the Sun
  *etc...

- Robert Hooke, an English scientist, discovered the cell with his own invention, the compound microscope
  *Developed law of elasticity (Hooke's law)
  *Perfected the air pump
  *etc...

- Isaac Newton despised his family life (especially his stepfather), but loved to understand nature
  *Went to Cambridge where he was a lousy student with no friends
  *Studied alchemy, hoping to change regular metals to gold or silver
  *Searched for secret messages in many translations of the Bible
  *Hooke accused Newton of stealing his discoveries about light, which wasn't true
  *Newton sent Hooke a letter detailing his mathematical calculations of planetary motion
  *Halley was determined to bring Newton's knowledge to the world, helping to publish Newton's "Principia"
  *Hooke continued to steal Newton's ideas, until Newton and Halley confronted him
  *Newton believed it was possible to overcome gravity, the basis of space travel

- Many of the theories about the future of the universe stem from Halley, who used Newton's laws to predict the path of Halley's comet, and much more
